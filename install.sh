# Install noapi-search-mcp on Linux from the GitHub releases of chriswirz/noapi-search-mcp-go.

#
# The script downloads the release binary for this machine's architecture,
# checks it against the published SHA256SUMS, and installs it as `noapi-search-mcp`.
#
# It installs system-wide into /usr/local/bin, mode 0755, so that the binary
# is on the default PATH for every account - which matters because an editor or
# an MCP client launches this server itself, often as a different user than the
# one that ran the installer. Only when it cannot write there (no sudo, or
# NOAPI_SEARCH_NO_SUDO=1) does it fall back to ~/.local/bin, which is reachable by
# your user alone; the script says so when that happens.
#
# Environment:
#   NOAPI_SEARCH_VERSION   release tag to install (default: the latest release)
#   NOAPI_SEARCH_INSTALL_DIR  where to put the binary (default: as described above)
#   NOAPI_SEARCH_NO_SUDO=1 never escalate; fall back to a user-local install
#
# POSIX sh on purpose: this has to run on whatever shell the machine has.
